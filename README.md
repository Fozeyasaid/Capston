Summary

    Healthy life expectancy is a multidimensional concept influenced by various factor's that contributes to an individual's overall health outcomes. By exploring some of the factors correlations, variations, and trends with in different demographic groups, I gained a valuable insight about the overall health and wellbeing globally.

Motivation

    I chose this project because I am curious about our health life expectancy, especially nowadays health and wellbeing have become more significant topics of concern everywhere.

Data Question

    - How does healthy life expectancy correlate with life expectancy, health expenditure, BMI and population in different demographic groups such as age, geographical regions and income groups across the world?
    - Are there any specific groups or countries where the relationship is particularly strong or week? 
    - How does the number of healthy years lose change overtime across different demographic groups?
    - What is the relationship between healthy life expectancy and BMI through time? Are there any patterns based on different BMI categories, and does it affect by gender?
