Summary/Introduction

    Healthy life expectancy is a multidimensional concept influenced by various factors that 
    contributes to an individual's overall health outcomes. By exploring some of the factorâ€™s
    correlations, variations, and trends with in different demographic groups, I gained a 
    valuable insight about the overall health expectancy and wellbeing globally.

Motivation

    I chose this project because one of my family members always complains about her health 
    after she had COVID-19. I was curious whether COVID-19 would impact our healthy life expectancy.
    However, after I explored all possible data sources about Covid-19, I found that it is too early
    to determine as a factor. Then I Keep looking to identify any potential factors that affect healthy
    life expectancy, GDP per capita and BMI might be one of the factors that influences our health 
    life expectancy outcomes.

Data Question

    How does healthy life expectancy correlate with GDP per capita in different demographic groups
    of the world? Is there any pattern based on different BMI categories overtime?

Known Issues and Challenges

    - Get data in my own data frame.
	- Looking UpToDate data.
    - Getting my project topic based on my interest.
    - found a lot of missing data especially in BMI table.

Conclusion
 In summary, my analysis reveals a positive correlation between healthy life expectancy and GDP per capita,
    indicating a potential contribution of economic development to improved health care and overall well-being.
    However, the relationship between healthy life expectancy and BMI is nuanced. Recognizing the importance of
    considering BMI along with other factors is crucial for having a significant connection. Uncovering  variations
    in income groups, regions and outliers in a specific country underscores the necessity for targeted policies on
    global scale. Overall analysis provides valuable insights to the complex interplay between health outcomes,
    economic development and lifestyle factors across a diverse nation, emphasizing the need for nuanced and 
    adaptable approaches to public health policies globally.
