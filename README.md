Summary/Introduction

    Healthy life expectancy is a multidimensional concept influenced by various factors that 
    contributes to an individual's overall health outcomes. By exploring some of the factorâ€™s
    correlations, variations, and trends with in different demographic groups, I gained a 
    valuable insight about the overall health expectancy and wellbeing globally.

Motivation

    I chose this project because one of my family members always complains about her health 
    after she had COVID-19. I was curious whether COVID-19 would impact our healthy life expectancy.
    However, after I explored all possible data sources about Covid-19, I found that it is too early
    to determine as a factor. Then I Keep looking to identify any potential factors that affect healthy
    life expectancy, GDP per capita and BMI might be one of the factors that influences our health 
    life expectancy outcomes.

Data Question

    How does healthy life expectancy correlate with GDP per capita in different demographic groups
    of the world? Is there any pattern based on different BMI categories overtime?

Conclusion
  In summary, my analysis highlights:

1.  A positive correlation between healthy life expectancy and GDP per capita, indicating that economic
    progress may positively impact healthcare and overall well-being.
2.  Recognition of an unclear correlation between healthy life expectancy and BMI, emphasizing the 
    importance of considering BMI along with other factors for accurate health outcomes.
3.  The importance of addressing differences in income groups, regions, and outliers within a specific
    country, underlining the need for specific global health plans that focus on variations worldwide.
