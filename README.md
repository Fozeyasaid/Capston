Summary/Introduction

    Healthy life expectancy is a multidimensional concept influenced by various factors that 
    contributes to an individual's overall health outcomes. By exploring some of the factorâ€™s
    correlations, variations, and trends with in different demographic groups, I gained a 
    valuable insight about the overall health expectancy and wellbeing globally.

Motivation

    I chose this project because one of my family members always complains about her health 
    after she had COVID-19. I was curious whether COVID-19 would impact our healthy life expectancy.
    However, after I explored all possible data sources about Covid-19, I found that it is too early
    to determine as a factor. Then I Keep looking to identify any potential factors that affect healthy
    life expectancy, GDP per capita and BMI might be one of the factors that influences our health 
    life expectancy outcomes.

Data Question

    How does healthy life expectancy correlate with GDP per capita in different demographic groups
    of the world? Is there any pattern based on different BMI categories overtime?

Conclusion
  In summary, my analysis shows a positive correlation between healthy life expectancy and GDP per capita,
  suggesting that economic progress may to improve healthcare and overall well-being. However, the relationship
  between healthy life expectancy and BMI is more complex, and it is crucial of considering other factors.
  Examining differences in income groups, regions, and outliers within a specific country highlights the necessity
  for targeted global health policies. Overall, the analysis provides valuable insights into global healthy life 
  expectancy and well-being.
